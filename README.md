# Small GitHub clone

## Description

This app is partly a copy of GitHub. Namely, the page with repositories has been recreated.
The app allows users to filter repositories by name using the search bar.
After clicking on the repository name, the user is redirected to the actual repository page.
This app is developed using React and Typescript. Interface is responsive.

It is deployed to Heroku, so you can check it out without cloning!

## How to run it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Future improvements

- Add "Type", "Language" and "Select order" filters functionality 
- Add updating of StargazerCount property of repository, after clicking the "Star" button
- Add the "Past year of activity" graph on the repository card. Now it is replaced with a static image
- Add other pages
- Write tests
- Add storybook and divide the components

## Feedback about this exercise

I really enjoyed this exercise. I would like to highlight these four points:

1) I got chance to work deeply with JSX(HTML) and CSS Layout, as I decided not to use any design framework.
Because of that I spent too much time working on layout, but, nevertheless, I polished my layout skills.

2) During accomplishing this exercise I worked with GraphQL API for the second time in my life.
It expanded my skills because I used to work with REST API most of the time.

3) This exercise seems to cover only basic knowledge of React.
But during working on it, I bumped into some extraordinary challenges.
Dealing with them, I deepened my knowledge in some aspects of React.

4) I've sent the [Link of the deployed project](https://github-clone-heroku.herokuapp.com) to a friend of mine.
She didn't manage to find it, because she thought I had sent her the link to my GitHub.
This means that I completed the task, although I did not aim to create an exact copy of the GitHub.
